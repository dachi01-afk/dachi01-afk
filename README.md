# Backend Development Enthusiast | Informatics Engineering Student

I am a final-year Informatics Engineering student who is currently 
focusing on learning and growing in the field of **Backend Development**.

My journey into backend development started with building web applications 
using PHP and frameworks such as CodeIgniter and Laravel. Through these experiences, 
I gained a foundational understanding of data management, authentication, 
and how business logic is implemented within a system.

In addition to development, I have experience as a 
**QC and Documentation Officer**, where I was involved in analyzing application flows, 
performing testing, and creating technical documentation. 
This experience shaped my perspective on backend development — not just as writing code, 
but as building a stable, well-tested, and maintainable system foundation.

At the moment, I am continuously strengthening my backend knowledge with a focus on:
- Backend structure and application architecture
- Database management and data relationships
- APIs and system integration
- Testing and technical documentation

I am open to and interested in **collaborating on various projects**, 
learning together, and sharing knowledge. 
I believe that great backend systems are built on strong system understanding 
and consistent learning.
